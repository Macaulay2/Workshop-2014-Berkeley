      Type of a noncommutative ring.
   Usage

   Description
      Text
         All noncommutative rings have this as an ancestor type.  It is the parent of the
	 types @ TO NCPolynomialRing @ and @ TO NCQuotientRing @. 
      Text
         In addition to defining a ring as a quotient of a @ TO NCPolynomialRing @, some common ways to create
	 NCRings include @ TO skewPolynomialRing @, @ TO endomorphismRing @, and @ TO oreExtension @.      
      
         Let's consider a three dimensional Sklyanin algebra.  We first define the tensor algebra:
      Example
         A = QQ{x,y,z}
      Text
         Then input the defining relations, and put them in an ideal:
      Example
	 f = y*z + z*y - x^2
	 g = x*z + z*x - y^2
	 h = z^2 - x*y - y*x
     	 I=ncIdeal{f,g,h}
      Text
         Next, define the quotient ring (as well as try a few functions on this new ring).  Note that
	 when the quotient ring is defined, a call is made to Bergman to compute the Groebner basis
	 of I (out to a certain degree, should the Groebner basis be infinite).
      Example
	 B=A/I
	 generators B
	 numgens B
	 isCommutative B
	 coefficientRing B
      Text
	 As we can see, x is an element of B.
      Example
         x
      Text
         If we define a new ring containing x, x is now part of that new ring
      Example
      	 C = skewPolynomialRing(QQ,(-1)_QQ,{x,y,z,w}) 
         x
      Text
         We can 'go back' to B using the command @ TO (use, NCRing) @.
      Example
	 use B
	 x
	 use C
      Text
         We can also create an Ore extension.  First define a @ TO NCRingMap @ with @ TO ncMap @.
      Example
	 sigma = ncMap(C,C,{y,z,w,x})
      Text
         Then call the command @ TO oreExtension @.
      Example
	 D = oreExtension(C,sigma,a)
	 generators D
	 numgens D
